Features: Near zero battery impact: you'll never notice any impact on battery at all. Extremely fast: it can scan small files (1MB) in 20ms, and even large files (40MB) in 1000ms. Memory efficient: with the default databases enabled it uses under 120MB. Regular scan: allowing selection of /system, internal storage, external storage, and installed apps. Realtime scanner: can detect malware in realtime on write/rename in internal storage. Completely offline: Internet is only used to download signature databases, files will never ever leave your device. Persistence: will automatically restart on boot/update. Tiny codebase: coming in at under 1000 sloc, it can be audited by even someone with basic programming experience. Minimal dependencies: the app only uses libraries when necessary. Signature databases can be enabled/disabled at the user's demand.",
